# Scrabble Counter

I build this project to help me collect data from the Scrabble games we play at home,
and either marvel or cry at the sight of our own vocabulary and resourcefulness.

## Technologies used

* SQLite3 for a small portable database.
* Kivy for building the interface.

I decided to use Kivy instead of Native tools or other cross-platform tools because
of the size of the project. Also, and for that same reason, I decided against a
web application, though I might change my mind in the end and also build it as
a web-app.
